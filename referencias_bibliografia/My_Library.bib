  abstract = {Mediastinitis continues to be an important and life-threatening complication after median sternotomy despite advances in prevention and treatment strategies, with an incidence of 0.25–5\%. It can also occur as extension of infection from adjacent structures such as the oesophagus, airways and lungs, or as descending necrotizing infection from the head and neck. In addition, there is a chronic form of ‘chronic fibrosing mediastinitis’ usually caused by granulomatous infections. In this expert consensus, the evidence for strategies for treatment and prevention of mediatinitis is reviewed in detail aiming at reducing the incidence and optimizing the management of this serious condition.},

  abstract = {Background Antibiotic over prescription for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in primary care exacerbates antimicrobial resistance. There is a need for effective alternatives to antibiotic prescribing. Honey is a lay remedy for URTIs, and has an emerging evidence base for its use. Honey has antimicrobial properties, and guidelines recommended honey for acute cough in children. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of honey for symptomatic relief in URTIs. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, AMED, Cab abstracts, Cochrane Library, LILACS, and CINAHL with a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. Results We identified 1345 unique records, and 14 studies were included. Overall risk of bias was moderate. Compared with usual care, honey improved combined symptom score (three studies, mean difference −3.96, 95\% CI −5.42 to −2.51, I2=0\%), cough frequency (eight studies, standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.36, 95\% CI −0.50 to −0.21, I2=0\%) and cough severity (five studies, SMD −0.44, 95\% CI −0.64 to −0.25, I2=20\%). We combined two studies comparing honey with placebo for relieving combined symptoms (SMD −0.63, 95\% CI −1.44 to 0.18, I2=91\%). Conclusions Honey was superior to usual care for the improvement of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. It provides a widely available and cheap alternative to antibiotics. Honey could help efforts to slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance, but further high quality, placebo controlled trials are needed.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thrombectomy is currently recommended for eligible patients with stroke who are treated within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with blinded outcome assessment, of thrombectomy in patients 6 to 16 hours after they were last known to be well and who had remaining ischemic brain tissue that was not yet infarcted. Patients with proximal middle-cerebral-artery or internal-carotid-artery occlusion, an initial infarct size of less than 70 ml, and a ratio of the volume of ischemic tissue on perfusion imaging to infarct volume of 1.8 or more were randomly assigned to endovascular therapy (thrombectomy) plus standard medical therapy (endovascular-therapy group) or standard medical therapy alone (medical-therapy group). The primary outcome was the ordinal score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability) at day 90. RESULTS: The trial was conducted at 38 U.S. centers and terminated early for efficacy after 182 patients had undergone randomization (92 to the endovascular-therapy group and 90 to the medical-therapy group). Endovascular therapy plus medical therapy, as compared with medical therapy alone, was associated with a favorable shift in the distribution of functional outcomes on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days (odds ratio, 2.77; P{$<$}0.001) and a higher percentage of patients who were functionally independent, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale of 0 to 2 (45\% vs. 17\%, P{$<$}0.001). The 90-day mortality rate was 14\% in the endovascular-therapy group and 26\% in the medical-therapy group (P=0.05), and there was no significant between-group difference in the frequency of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7\% and 4\%, respectively; P=0.75) or of serious adverse events (43\% and 53\%, respectively; P=0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke 6 to 16 hours after a patient was last known to be well plus standard medical therapy resulted in better functional outcomes than standard medical therapy alone among patients with proximal middle-cerebral-artery or internal-carotid-artery occlusion and a region of tissue that was ischemic but not yet infarcted.

  abstract = {Background:~The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.         Methods:~We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.         Results:~The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy.         Conclusion:~The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new evidence in further releases of these guidelines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to affect millions worldwide. Given the rapidly growing evidence base, we implemented a living guideline model to provide guidance on the management of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. METHODS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Disease 2019 panel has expanded to include 43 experts from 14 countries; all panel members completed an electronic conflict-of-interest disclosure form. In this update, the panel addressed nine questions relevant to managing severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. We used the World Health Organization’s definition of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019. The systematic reviews team searched the literature for relevant evidence, aiming to identify systematic reviews and clinical trials. When appropriate, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize treatment effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, then used the evidence-to-decision framework to generate recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued nine statements (three new and six updated) related to ICU patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. For severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the panel strongly recommends using systemic corticosteroids and venous thromboprophylaxis but strongly recommends against using hydroxychloroquine. In addition, the panel suggests using dexamethasone (compared with other corticosteroids) and suggests against using convalescent plasma and therapeutic anticoagulation outside clinical trials. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel suggests using remdesivir in nonventilated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and suggests against starting remdesivir in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 outside clinical trials. Because of insufficient evidence, the panel did not issue a recommendation on the use of awake prone positioning. CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued several recommendations to guide healthcare professionals caring for adults with critical or severe coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. Based on a living guideline model the recommendations will be updated as new evidence becomes available.},

  abstract = {Background Deep Learning opens up opportunities for routinely scanning large bodies of biomedical literature and clinical narratives to represent the meaning of biomedical and clinical terms. However, the validation and integration of this knowledge on a scale requires cross checking with ground truths (i.e. evidence-based resources) that are unavailable in an actionable or computable form. In this paper we explore how to turn information about diagnoses, prognoses, therapies and other clinical concepts into computable knowledge using free-text data about human and animal health. We used a Semantic Deep Learning approach that combines the Semantic Web technologies and Deep Learning to acquire and validate knowledge about 11 well-known medical conditions mined from two sets of unstructured free-text data: 300\,K PubMed Systematic Review articles (the PMSB dataset) and 2.5\,M veterinary clinical notes (the VetCN dataset). For each target condition we obtained 20 related clinical concepts using two deep learning methods applied separately on the two datasets, resulting in 880 term pairs (target term, candidate term). Each concept, represented by an n-gram, is mapped to UMLS using MetaMap; we also developed a bespoke method for mapping short forms (e.g. abbreviations and acronyms). Existing ontologies were used to formally represent associations. We also create ontological modules and illustrate how the extracted knowledge can be queried. The evaluation was performed using the content within BMJ Best Practice. Results MetaMap achieves an F measure of 88\% (precision 85\%, recall 91\%) when applied directly to the total of 613 unique candidate terms for the 880 term pairs. When the processing of short forms is included, MetaMap achieves an F measure of 94\% (precision 92\%, recall 96\%). Validation of the term pairs with BMJ Best Practice yields precision between 98 and 99\%. Conclusions The Semantic Deep Learning approach can transform neural embeddings built from unstructured free-text data into reliable and reusable One Health knowledge using ontologies and content from BMJ Best Practice.},

  abstract = {Fiberoptic-compatible oral airways (FCOAs) combine the simplicity and benefits that traditional oral airways provide, with the advantage of mechanically guiding fiberoptic intubation. This review examines and compares the salient properties of these devices. Of note, the clinician should pay particular attention to the location and depth of the channel. FCOAs, with an anterior channel, may be advantageous for use with difficult intubations arising from an excessively anterior-oriented glottis, whereas a channel with excessive depth may hinder the localization of a glottis which is off-midline. In certain circumstances, channel size will limit tracheal tube size. The intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway (iLMA) is also included in this comparison. Although this device may have an advantage in performing blind intubations, its use, even with a fiberscope, may be limited. This limitation applies to intubations in which mouth opening is restricted, the glottis is off-midline, airway tumors are present, or with the presence of prior cervical radiotherapy. Furthermore, because of its size, the iLMA can potentially cause airway trauma, which could subsequently limit the utility of a fiberscope. In addition, the FCOA can generate greater positive-pressure ventilation, when used with a tight-fitting face mask, than the iLMA. FCOAs offer clinicians the ability to visualize airway anatomy while allowing straightforward access for tracheal intubation.},

  abstract = {A patient with extremely high calcium level of 23.9\,mg/dL (5.97\,mmol/L) was admitted to our department unconscious with pathological ECG recording, demonstrating shortening of QT interval. The patient was treated by fluid resuscitation, bisphosphonates, salmon calcitonin and steroids. Haemodialysis with low calcium bath had been promptly provided with improvement of consciousness and calcium level. ECG changes disappeared. Subsequent investigations revealed hyperparathyroidism and a large parathyroid adenoma was then surgically removed. Extreme and rapid calcium elevation (parathyroid crisis) is rarely seen in primary hyperparathyroidism and usually is distinctive for malignancy. In the context of acute kidney injury and refractory hypercalcaemia with life-threatening complications (coma, ECG changes with impending danger of arrhythmia), haemodialysis may effectively decrease calcium levels. It should be pointed out that dialysis is an efficient method of treatment of refractory hypercalcaemia, parathyroid crisis, but it is rarely used due to its invasive nature.},

  abstract = {Considerable progress has been made over the last decades in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation(MV) remains the cornerstone of supportive therapy for ARDS. Lung-protective MV minimizes the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improves survival. Several parameters contribute to the risk of VILI and require careful setting including tidal volume (VT), plateau pressure (Pplat), driving pressure (ΔP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and respiratory rate. Measurement of energy and mechanical power allows quantification of the relatives contribution of various parameters (VT, Pplat, ΔP, PEEP, respiratory rate, and airflow) for the individualization of MV settings. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents mainly in cases of severe ARDS can improve oxygenation and reduce asynchrony, although they are not known to confer a survival benefit. Rescue respiratory therapies such as prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, and extracorporeal support techniques may be adopted in specific situations. Furthermore, respiratory weaning protocols should aloso be considered. Based on a review of recent clinical trials, we present 10 golden rules for individualized MV in ARDS management.},

  abstract = {The majority of women undergoing cesarean delivery in the United States receive neuraxial morphine, the most effective form of postoperative analgesia for this surgery. Current American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) recommend respiratory monitoring standards following neuraxial morphine administration in the general surgical population that may be too frequent and intensive when applied to the healthy obstetric population receiving a single dose of neuraxial morphine at the time of surgery. There is limited evidence to support or guide the optimal modality, frequency, and duration of respiratory monitoring in the postoperative cesarean delivery patient receiving a single dose of neuraxial morphine. Consistent with the mission of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) to improve outcomes in pregnancy for women and neonates, the purpose of this consensus statement is to encourage the use of this highly effective analgesic technique while promoting safe practice and patient-centered care. The document aims to reduce unnecessary interruptions from respiratory monitoring in healthy mothers while focusing vigilance on monitoring in those women at highest risk for respiratory depression following neuraxial morphine administration. This consensus statement promotes the use of low-dose neuraxial morphine and multimodal analgesia after cesarean delivery, gives perspective on the safety of this analgesic technique in healthy women, and promotes patient risk stratification and perioperative risk assessment to determine and adjust the intensity, frequency, and duration of respiratory monitoring.},

Of these, 2377 patients developed ARDS in the first 48 hours and whose respiratory failure was managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. The period prevalence of mild ARDS was 30.0\% (95\% CI, 28.2\%-31.9\%); of moderate ARDS, 46.6\% (95\% CI, 44.5\%-48.6\%); and of severe ARDS, 23.4\% (95\% CI, 21.7\%-25.2\%). ARDS represented 0.42 cases per ICU bed over 4 weeks and represented 10.4\% (95\% CI, 10.0\%-10.7\%) of ICU admissions and 23.4\% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Clinical recognition of ARDS ranged from 51.3\% (95\% CI, 47.5\%-55.0\%) in mild to 78.5\% (95\% CI, 74.8\%-81.8\%) in severe ARDS. Less than two-thirds of patients with ARDS received a tidal volume 8 of mL/kg or less of predicted body weight.

In the LUNG SAFE study, the largest international cohort of patients with ARDS, investigators were able to determine if ARDS was present, and at what stage the clinician made the diagnosis of ARDS. The diagnosis of ARDS was delayed or missed in two-thirds of patients, with the diagnosis missed entirely in 40\% of patients, while ARDS recognition ranged from 51\% in mild ARDS to 79\% in severe cases. Failure to recognize ARDS in a timely fashion leads to failure to use strategies that improve survival in ARDS. Early diagnosis of ARDS may facilitate measures to abrogate progression of the lung injury, including protective mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and adjunctive measures proven to improve survival such as prone positioning. Information overload and a complex 'syndrome' diagnosis likely play key roles in ARDS under-recognition. Clinical under-recognition has important consequences particularly in terms of therapeutic options not considered. The development of approaches to enable more timely recognition has the potential to save lives.},

  abstract = {Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most demanding conditions in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Management of analgesia and sedation in ARDS is particularly challenging. An expert panel was convened to produce a “state-of-the-art” article to support clinicians in the optimal management of analgesia/sedation in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, including those with COVID-19. Current ICU analgesia/sedation guidelines promote analgesia first and minimization of sedation, wakefulness, delirium prevention and early rehabilitation to facilitate ventilator and ICU liberation. However, these strategies cannot always be applied to patients with ARDS who sometimes require deep sedation and/or paralysis. Patients with severe ARDS may be under-represented in analgesia/sedation studies and currently recommended strategies may not be feasible. With lightened sedation, distress-related symptoms (e.g., pain and discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea) and patient-ventilator asynchrony should be systematically assessed and managed through interprofessional collaboration, prioritizing analgesia and anxiolysis. Adaptation of ventilator settings (e.g., use of a pressure-set mode, spontaneous breathing, sensitive inspiratory trigger) should be systematically considered before additional medications are administered. Managing the mechanical ventilator is of paramount importance to avoid the unnecessary use of deep sedation and/or paralysis. Therefore, applying an “ABCDEF-R” bundle (R\,=\,Respiratory-drive-control) may be beneficial in ARDS patients. Further studies are needed, especially regarding the use and long-term effects of fast-offset drugs (e.g., remifentanil, volatile anesthetics) and the electrophysiological assessment of analgesia/sedation (e.g., electroencephalogram devices, heart-rate variability, and video pupillometry). This review is particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic given drug shortages and limited ICU-bed capacity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is common, but reliable evidence-based recommendations are still limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to explore nurses' and physicians' experiences and approaches to ICU delirium management. METHOD: Our study had a qualitative multicentre~design using interdisciplinary focus groups and framework analysis. Participants were strategically selected to include nurses and physicians with experience in delirium management at five ICUs in four out of five regions in Denmark. RESULTS: We conducted eight focus group interviews with 24 nurses and 15 physicians; median ICU experience was 9 years (range 1-35). The main issues identified were~(1) the decision to treat or not to treat ICU delirium based on delirium phenotype, (2) the decision to act based on experience or evidence, and (3) the decision to intervene using nursing care or medications. ICU delirium was treated with pharmacological interventions in patients with signs of agitation, hallucinations, and sleep deprivation. The first choice of agent was haloperidol or olanzapine. Agitated and combative patients received benzodiazepines, propofol, or dexmedetomidine. Calm delirious patients were managed with non-pharmacological solutions. Physicians recommended pro re nata (PRN) orders to prevent over medication, whereas nurses opposed PRN orders with the fear that it would increase their responsibilities. CONCLUSION: Our study described an algorithm of contemporary delirium management in Danish ICUs based on qualitative inquiry. When evidence-based solutions are unclear, nurses and physicians rely on personal experience, collective experience, and best available evidence to determine which patients to treat and what methods to use to treat ICU delirium. Delirium management still needs clear objectives and guidelines with evidence-based recommendations for first-line treatment and subsequent treatment options.},

The Difficult Airway Society’s 2015 guidelines recommend that videolaryngoscopes should be immediately available at all times and that all anaesthetists should be trained and skilled in their use.Methods. An electronic survey was sent to all UK National Health Service hospitals to examine availability, use, and attitudes to videolaryngoscopy, and closed in January 2014.Results. The return rate was 67\%. Videolaryngoscopy was available in 91\% of operating theatres, ∼50\% of intensive care units (ICUs) and obstetric theatres, with lower availability in emergency departments (EDs), paediatric anaesthesia, and independent sector hospitals. The most widely available devices were the Airtraq, the GlideScope, and C-MAC. Approximately one in seven respondents reported availability of videolaryngoscopy in all clinical areas. Most departments imposed restrictions on videolaryngoscopy use, especially the ICU and ED. Device selection was only infrequently based on published literature or formal trial. Structured introduction of videolaryngoscopy into practice was uncommon. Penetration of videolaryngoscopy was highly variable; fewer than a third reported widespread use or enthusiasm, although this increased where the C-MAC and GlideScope were widely available.Conclusions. Videolaryngoscopy is available in most hospitals’ main operating departments, but in fewer than half of other locations. There is marked variation in device, methods of introduction, usage, and clinical adoption. Most hospitals need to change practice to comply with current guidelines. Selection and implementation vary widely.},

The place for microcirculation-targeted therapy is debated as well as the use of alternative techniques (blood purification) and therapies (vitamin C). The implications of hemodynamic alterations on antibiotic doses is discussed. Finally, the specific challenges in low- and middle-income countries are addressed. Ongoing trials address some of these challenges, but many uncertainties will remain, and individualized therapies based on careful clinical assessment will continue to be essential to optimizing the care of patients with septic shock.},

  abstract = {Obesity is an important risk factor for major complications, morbidity and mortality related to intubation procedures and ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The fall in functional residual capacity promotes airway closure and atelectasis formation. This narrative review presents the impact of obesity on the respiratory system and the key points to optimize airway management, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU patients with obesity. Non-invasive strategies should first optimize body position with reverse Trendelenburg position or sitting position. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is considered as the first-line therapy in patients with obesity having a postoperative acute respiratory failure. Positive pressure pre-oxygenation before the intubation procedure is the method of reference. The use of videolaryngoscopy has to be considered by adequately trained intensivists, especially in patients with several risk factors. Regarding mechanical ventilation in patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), low tidal volume (6~ml/kg of predicted body weight) and moderate to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with careful recruitment maneuver in selected patients, are advised. Prone positioning is a therapeutic choice in severe ARDS patients with obesity. Prophylactic NIV should be considered after extubation to prevent re-intubation. If obesity increases mortality and risk of ICU admission in the overall population, the impact of obesity on ICU mortality is less clear and several confounding factors have to be taken into account regarding the “obesity ICU paradox”.},

The main aim of this study was to investigate the short-term efficacy of CS loco-regional treatment performed under US guidance in tenosynovitis of patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis.Methods. Thirty consecutive patients affected by chronic arthritis and with clinical suspicion of tenosynovitis were recruited to undergo US assessment. In the sonographically proven cases, US-guided CS injection was performed. A visual analogue scale for pain (ranging from 0 to 10) and a tenderness score (ranging from 0 to 3) were used for the clinical evaluation. Sonographic pathological findings indicative of tenosynovitis were scored using a semi-quantitative 4-grade scoring system, for both grey-scale and power Doppler US, at baseline and during a follow-up visit at 2 weeks after the CS injection.Results. In 21 (70\%) of 30 patients, the clinical suspicion of tenosynovitis was confirmed (9 with RA, 11 with PsA and 1 with ReA). In the other nine patients, US revealed synovitis of the adjacent joints, bursitis, oedema of the s.c. tissue or a partial tear. In all cases the appropriate needle placement and subsequent CS injection into the tendon sheath were obtained with US confirmation. A significant reduction in all clinical and sonographic scorings was found during the follow-up visit.Conclusions. The present study shows the efficacy of US-guided peritendinous CS injections in the management of patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis presenting as US-proven tenosynovitis.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, critical care has matured in a myriad of ways resulting in dramatically higher survival rates for our sickest patients. For millions of new survivors comes de novo suffering and disability called the Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). Patients with PICS are robbed of their normal cognitive, emotional, and physical capacity and cannot resume their previous life. The ICU Liberation Collaborative is a real-world quality improvement (QI) initiative being implemented across 76 ICUs designed to engage strategically the ABCDEF bundle through team- and evidence-based care. This article explains the science and philosophy of liberating ICU patients and families from harm that is both inherent to critical illness and iatrogenic. ICU Liberation is an extensive program designed to facilitate implementation of the Pain, Agitation, and Delirium (PAD) guidelines, using the evidence-based ABCDEF Bundle. Participating ICU teams adapt data from hundreds of peer-reviewed studies to operationalize a systematic and reliable methodology that shifts ICU culture from the harmful inertia of sedation and restraints to an animated ICU filled with patients who are awake, cognitively engaged, and mobile with family members engaged as partners with the ICU team at the bedside. In so doing, patients are liberated from iatrogenic aspects of care that threaten her or his sense of self-worth and human dignity. The goal of this 2017 plenary lecture at the 47th SCCM Congress is to provide clinical ICU teams a synthesis of the literature that led to the creation of ICU Liberation philosophy and to explain how this patient- and family-centered, QI program is novel, generalizable, and practice-changing.},

  abstract = {Background Patients with septic shock commonly require endotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia in the operating theatre, the emergency department, and the intensive care unit. Hypotension is a serious complication after induction of general anaesthesia, especially in patients with circulatory failure. No randomised controlled trials had previously investigated protocols for induction of anaesthesia in septic shock patients. The aim of the current work is to compare two protocols, lidocaine–ketamine combination versus ketamine full-dose for rapid-sequence endotracheal intubation in patients with septic shock. Methods Forty-four adult patients, with septic shock, scheduled for emergency surgical intervention were enrolled in this randomised, double-blinded, controlled study. Patients were randomised to receive either 1 mg/kg ketamine (ketamine group, n = 22) or 0.5 mg/kg ketamine plus 1 mg/kg lidocaine (ketamine-lidocaine group, n = 22) for induction of anaesthesia in addition to 0.05 mg/kg midazolam (in both groups). Our primary outcome was the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Other outcomes included frequency of post-induction hypotension, heart rate, and cardiac output. Results Forty-three patients were available for final analysis. The average MAP reading in the first 5 min post-induction was higher in ketamine-lidocaine group than in the ketamine group \{82.8 ± 5.6 mmHg and 73 ± 10.2 mmHg, P {$<$} 0.001\}. Furthermore, the incidence of post-intubation hypotension was lower in the ketamine-lidocaine group than in the ketamine group \{1 patient (5\%) versus 17 patients (77\%), P {$<$} 0.001\}. The ketamine-lidocaine group showed higher MAP in almost all the readings after induction compared to ketamine group. Other haemodynamic variables including cardiac output and heart rate were comparable between both study groups. Conclusion Lidocaine–ketamine combination showed less incidence of hypotension compared to ketamine full-dose when used for rapid-sequence endotracheal intubation in patients with septic shock.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent attention to adverse effects of intensive care unit (ICU) sedation has led to the use of strategies that target a “lighter” depth of sedation. Among these strategies are “analgosedation” protocols, which prioritize pain management and preferentially use IV opioids before administration of continuously infused sedatives such as propofol or midazolam. We hypothesized that using an analgosedation protocol would result in a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation than a protocol with greater emphasis on IV sedatives METHODS We conducted a retrospective study comparing the duration of mechanical ventilation before and after implementation of an analgosedation protocol in a 24-bed medical ICU. Patients were aged 18 years or older and required mechanical ventilation where a light level of sedation was clinically appropriate. Exclusion criteria included a clinical need for deeper levels of sedation or tracheal intubation confined to the perioperative period. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients were included in the postimplementation group and 65 in the preimplementation group. After adjustment for baseline covariates, introduction of the 2013 analgosedation protocol was associated with a decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (−26.62 hours; 95\% confidence interval, − 44.98 to −8.26, P = 0.005). Patients managed with the analgosedation protocol experienced a lighter level of sedation (median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, −2.57 vs −1.25, P = 0.001) and improved pain management (median Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool score, 2.0 vs 1.5, P = 0.03). The use of continuously infused sedatives was reduced by 54.3\% (92.3\% vs 38.0\%, P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that implementation of an analgosedation protocol was associated with an overall lighter level of sedation, shorter mean ventilator duration, and a reduced use of continuous infusion sedatives. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of such protocols on ICU delirium.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the association of noninvasive oxygenation strategies with mortality and endotracheal intubation in adults with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. DATA SOURCES The following bibliographic databases were searched from inception until April 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS. No limits were applied to language, publication year, sex, or race. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials enrolling adult participants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure comparing high-flow nasal oxygen, face mask noninvasive ventilation, helmet noninvasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted individual study data and evaluated studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Network meta-analyses using a bayesian framework to derive risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences along with 95\% credible intervals (CrIs) were conducted. GRADE methodology was used to rate the certainty in findings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was all-cause mortality up to 90 days. A secondary outcome was endotracheal intubation up to 30 days. RESULTS Twenty-five randomized clinical trials (3804 participants) were included. Compared with standard oxygen, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.40 [95\% CrI, 0.24-0.63]; absolute risk difference, −0.19 [95\% CrI, −0.37 to −0.09]; low certainty) and face mask noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.83 [95\% CrI, 0.68-0.99]; absolute risk difference, −0.06 [95\% CrI, −0.15 to −0.01]; moderate certainty) were associated with a lower risk of mortality (21 studies [3370 patients]). Helmet noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.26 [95\% CrI, 0.14-0.46]; absolute risk difference, −0.32 [95\% CrI, −0.60 to −0.16]; low certainty), face mask noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.76 [95\% CrI, 0.62-0.90]; absolute risk difference, −0.12 [95\% CrI, −0.25 to −0.05]; moderate certainty) and high-flow nasal oxygen (RR, 0.76 [95\% CrI, 0.55-0.99]; absolute risk difference, −0.11 [95\% CrI, −0.27 to −0.01]; moderate certainty) were associated with lower risk of endotracheal intubation (25 studies [3804 patients]). The risk of bias due to lack of blinding for intubation was deemed high. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this network meta-analysis of trials of adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, treatment with noninvasive oxygenation strategies compared with standard oxygen therapy was associated with lower risk of death. Further research is needed to better understand the relative benefits of each strategy.},

  abstract = {Intravenous lidocaine is used widely for its effect on postoperative pain and recovery but it can be, and has been, fatal when used inappropriately and incorrectly. The risk-benefit ratio of i.v. lidocaine varies with type of surgery and with patient factors such as comorbidity (including pre-existing chronic pain). This consensus statement aims to address three questions. First, does i.v. lidocaine effectively reduce postoperative pain and facilitate recovery? Second, is i.v. lidocaine safe? Third, does the fact that i.v. lidocaine is not licensed for this indication affect its use? We suggest that i.v. lidocaine should be regarded as a ‘high-risk’ medicine. Individual anaesthetists may feel that, in selected patients, i.v. lidocaine may be beneficial as part of a multimodal perioperative pain management strategy. This approach should be approved by hospital medication governance systems, and the individual clinical decision should be made with properly informed consent from the patient concerned. If i.v. lidocaine is used, we recommend an initial dose of no more than 1.5 mg.kg-1, calculated using the patient’s ideal body weight and given as an infusion over 10 min. Thereafter, an infusion of no more than 1.5 mg.kg-1.h-1 for no longer than 24 h is recommended, subject to review and re-assessment. Intravenous lidocaine should not be used at the same time as, or within the period of action of, other local anaesthetic interventions. This includes not starting i.v. lidocaine within 4 h after any nerve block, and not performing any nerve block until 4 h after discontinuing an i.v. lidocaine infusion.},

  abstract = {The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined in 1994 by the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC); since then, issues regarding the reliability and validity of this definition have emerged. Using a consensus process, a panel of experts convened in 2011 (an initiative of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine) developed the Berlin Definition, focusing on feasibility, reliability, validity, and objective evaluation of its performance. A draft definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg \&lt; PaO\textsubscript{2}/FIO\textsubscript{2} ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg \&lt; PaO\textsubscript{2}/FIO\textsubscript{2} ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO\textsubscript{2}/FIO\textsubscript{2} ≤ 100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance (≤40 mL/cm H\textsubscript{2}O), positive end-expiratory pressure (≥10 cm H\textsubscript{2}O), and corrected expired volume per minute (≥10 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188 patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269 patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27\%; 95\% CI, 24\%-30\%; 32\%; 95\% CI, 29\%-34\%; and 45\%; 95\% CI, 42\%-48\%, respectively; P \&lt; .001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile [IQR], 2-11; 7 days; IQR, 4-14; and 9 days; IQR, 5-17, respectively; P \&lt; .001). Compared with the AECC definition, the final Berlin Definition had better predictive validity for mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.577 (95\% CI, 0.561-0.593) vs 0.536 (95\% CI, 0.520-0.553; P \&lt; .001). This updated and revised Berlin Definition for ARDS addresses a number of the limitations of the AECC definition. The approach of combining consensus discussions with empirical evaluation may serve as a model to create more accurate, evidence-based, critical illness syndrome definitions and to better inform clinical care, research, and health services planning.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist with emerging evidence assessing its use as a continuous infusion agent to provide concomitant analgesia and sedation. The role of ketamine as adjunctive therapy in mechanically ventilated patients is unclear. This study sought to investigate the impact of adjunctive continuous infusion ketamine on concomitant analgesic and sedative dosing while providing goal comfort in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: This retrospective, two-center, intrapatient comparison study included mechanically ventilated, adult ICU patients who received continuous infusion ketamine with at least one other analgesic or sedative infusion. The primary outcome assessed percent relative change in concomitant analgesic-sedative doses 24 hours after ketamine initiation. Secondary outcomes included percent of Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score (RASS) assessments at goal, adverse effects, and delirium incidence. Exploratory evaluation of independent factors associated with ketamine responders ({$>$}50\% relative reduction in analgesic-sedative dosing requirements at 24 hours) and nonresponders ({$<$}50\% relative reduction) was performed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients were included. A total of 160 concomitant analgesic-sedative infusions were utilized in combination with ketamine, most commonly fentanyl (98 [61.3\%]) and propofol (46 [28.8\%]). A 20\% [IQR -63.6-0.0, p{$<$}0.001] relative reduction in total analgesic-sedative infusion pharmacotherapy was achieved at 24 hours after ketamine initiation. Analgesic and sedative infusion doses decreased at 24 hours (fentanyl: pre, 175 μg/hr [IQR 100-200 μg/hr] vs post, 125 μg/hr [IQR 50-200 μg/hr], p{$<$}0.001; propofol: pre, 42.5 μg/kg/min [IQR 20.0-60.0 μg/kg/min] vs post, 20.0 μg/kg/min [IQR 3.8-31.3 μg/kg/min], p{$<$}0.001). Median percent time within goal RASS improved after ketamine initiation (pre, 7.1\% [0-40\%] vs post, 25\% [0-66.7\%]; p=0.005). No differences were observed in secondary outcomes between responders and nonresponders, except a longer non-ICU hospital LOS in responders. Independent factors associated with ketamine response included a lower body mass index, higher starting dose of ketamine, lower severity of illness, and need for multiple concomitant analgesic-sedative infusions prior to initiation of ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive continuous infusion ketamine promotes analgesic and sedative dose-sparing effects in mechanically ventilated patients while improving time spent within goal sedation range. Further, prospective research is warranted. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is a neurological condition with an overall prevalence in adults of 5-10\% in Europe and North America. It is characterised by strong feelings of restlessness and distressing paraesthesia-like sensations in the lower legs, particularly when at rest. The symptoms vary considerably in severity and frequency. RLS/WED has a variable clinical expression influenced by genetic, environmental, and medical factors. Research into the pathophysiology of RLS/WED has found that various genetic markers and existing dysfunctions in dopaminergic mechanisms and iron mechanisms play a central role. Until recently, the first line treatment of RLS/WED was with low dose dopamine agonists, with three drugs having been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. However, the occurrence of dopaminergic augmentation and an overall increase in severity of symptoms during long term treatment with dopamine agonists is leading to a shift towards non-dopaminergic alternatives as initial treatments, and particularly to α2δ ligands. Recent international guidelines recommend, whenever possible, to start treatment with these drugs (α2δ ligands) to avoid augmentation from the start. Other (eg, glutamatergic or adenosine) neurotransmitters might also play an important role in causing RLS/WED and might thus lead to new treatments.},

The intervertebral disc is considered the etiologic source in up to 40\% of patients, with considerable previous efforts directed at developing reliable and efficacious treatments.~ Recent publications, including a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, using a one-time treatment of methylene blue, showed statistically significant, clinically relevant improvements in pain and function in the treatment groups. The postulated mechanism of action of methylene blue is denervation of small nociceptive fibers that grow into the annulus fibrosis, which are implicated in discogenic pain. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Academic pain management center. OBJECTIVES To examine the outcomes for a cohort of patients treated with methylene blue for discogenic pain, discuss potential differences in selection and administration protocols and briefly review other proposed treatments for discogenic pain (e.g. intradiscal electrothermy therapy, intradiscal steroids, intradiscal biaccuplasty, rami communicans radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and chymopapain). METHODS This case series examines the pain and functional outcomes in 8 patients treated with a one-time administration of methylene blue for discogenic back pain.~ Follow-up information was available between 2 months and over one year, depending on the patient. RESULTS Application of this treatment for these 8 patients for discogenic pain diagnosed by provocation discography showed only one clinical success at our center.~ Four patients had a time-limited clinical response in pain and/or function between 2 weeks and 5 months. Patient specific data are outlined in detail herein. CONCLUSIONS Low back pain ascribed to a discogenic source continues to be an elusive clinical entity to treat.~~ We have reserved further treatment of methylene blue for discogenic pain until other controlled trials have been published.

They are a direct response to the 4\textsuperscript{th} National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society, which highlighted deficient management of these extremely vulnerable patients leading to major complications and avoidable deaths. They are founded on robust evidence where available, supplemented by expert consensus opinion where it is not. These guidelines recognize that improved outcomes of emergency airway management require closer attention to human factors, rather than simply introduction of new devices or improved technical proficiency. They stress the role of the airway team, a shared mental model, planning, and communication throughout airway management. The primacy of oxygenation including pre- and peroxygenation is emphasized. A modified rapid sequence approach is recommended. Optimal management is presented in an algorithm that combines Plans B and C, incorporating elements of the Vortex approach. To avoid delays and task fixation, the importance of limiting procedural attempts, promptly recognizing failure, and transitioning to the next algorithm step are emphasized. The guidelines recommend early use of a videolaryngoscope, with a screen visible to all, and second generation supraglottic airways for airway rescue. Recommendations for emergency front of neck airway are for a scalpel–bougie–tube technique while acknowledging the value of other techniques performed by trained experts. As most critical care airway catastrophes occur after intubation, from dislodged or blocked tubes, essential methods to avoid these complications are also emphasized.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.},

  abstract = {Long-term cognitive impairment is common among ICU survivors, but its natural history remains unclear. In this systematic review, we report the frequency of cognitive impairment in ICU survivors across various time points after ICU discharge that were extracted from 46 of the 3,350 screened records. Prior studies used a range of cognitive instruments, including subjective assessments (10 studies), single or screening cognitive test such as Mini-Mental State Examination or Trail Making Tests A and B (23 studies), and comprehensive cognitive batteries (26 studies). The mean prevalence of cognitive impairment was higher with objective rather than subjective assessments (54\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 51–57\%] vs. 35\% [95\% CI, 29–41\%] at 3 months after ICU discharge) and when comprehensive cognitive batteries rather than Mini-Mental State Examination were used (ICU discharge: 61\% [95\% CI, 38–100\%] vs. 36\% [95\% CI, 15–63\%]; 12 months after ICU discharge: 43\% [95\% CI, 10–78\%] vs. 18\% [95\% CI, 10–20\%]). Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome had higher prevalence of cognitive impairment than mixed ICU patients at ICU discharge (82\% [95\% CI, 78–86\%] vs. 48\% [95\% CI, 44–52\%]). Although some studies repeated tests at more than one time point, the time intervals between tests were arbitrary and dictated by operational limitations of individual studies or chosen cognitive instruments. In summary, the prevalence and temporal trajectory of ICU-related cognitive impairment varies depending on the type of cognitive instrument used and the etiology of critical illness. Future studies should use modern comprehensive batteries to better delineate the natural history of cognitive recovery across ICU patient subgroups and determine which acute illness and treatment factors are associated with better recovery trajectories.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Current data suggest potential benefits with β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy for empiric treatment of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, it is unclear whether deescalation to β-lactam monotherapy in the absence of positive results on diagnostic tests, such as the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 (BioFire polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), affects clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between patients with negative BioFire PCR results deescalated to β-lactam monotherapy with those not deescalated. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study assessed the in-hospital mortality rates of critically ill adults with CAP treated for ≥48~h with combination β-lactam and azithromycin therapy. Additional end points included hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, duration of mechanical ventilatory support, 30-day readmission, and incidence of azithromycin-related adverse effects. FINDINGS: A total of 94 patients were included: 53 in the deescalation group and 41 in the nondeescalation group. No difference was observed with respect to in-hospital mortality (2.4\% vs 11.3\%, P~=~0.312), although patients in the deescalated group experienced shorter ICU (1.9 vs 3.4 days, P~=~0.029) and hospital LOS (6 vs 7 days, P~=~0.025). No differences were found between groups with respect to additional secondary end points. Simple logistic regression confirmed that deescalation was not associated with hospital mortality (odds ratio~=~0.17, 95\% CI, 0.02-1.70). IMPLICATIONS: In this study of ICU patients with severe CAP and a negative BioFire PCR result, deescalation from combination β-lactam and macrolide therapy to β-lactam monotherapy was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality but was associated with decreased hospital and ICU LOS. Larger prospective studies are warranted to verify these findings.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5–6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57·0 (IQR 47·0–65·0) years and 897 (52\%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186·0 (175·0–199·0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63\%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26\%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23\% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24\% for those at severity scale 3, 22\% for severity scale 4, and 29\% for severity scale 5–6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22\% for severity scale 3, 29\% for scale 4, and 56\% for scale 5–6, and median CT scores were 3·0 (IQR 2·0–5·0) for severity scale 3, 4·0 (3·0–5·0) for scale 4, and 5·0 (4·0–6·0) for scale 5–6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1·61 (95\% CI 0·80–3·25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4·60 (1·85–11·48) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0·88 (0·66–1·17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1·77 (1·05–2·97) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0·74 (0·58–0·96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2·69 (1·46–4·96) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96·2\% \emph{vs} 58·5\%) and median titres (19·0 \emph{vs} 10·0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1·73 m\textsuperscript{2} or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1·73 m\textsuperscript{2} at follow-up.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences, National Key Research and Development Program of China, Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and Peking Union Medical College Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Patients are admitted to the surgical intensive care (SICU) unit after emergency and elective surgery. After elective surgery, for further support, or to manage coexisting comorbidities. The implementation of the ERAS (Enhanced recovery after surgery) protocols in surgery should decrease the need for ICU beds, but there will always be unpredicted complications after surgery. These will require individual management. What we can do for our surgical patients in ICU to further enhance their recovery? To promote early enhanced recovery in surgical intensive care—SICU, three areas need to be addressed, sedation, analgesia, and delirium. Tools for measurement and protocols for management in these three areas should be developed to ensure best practice in each SICU. The fourth important area is Nutrition. Preoperative screening and post-operative measurement of the state of nutrition also need to be developed in the SICU. The fifth important area is early mobilization. ERAS protocols encourage early mobilization of the critically ill patients, even if on mechanical ventilation. Early mobilization is possible and should be implemented by special multidisciplinary ICU team. All team members must be familiar with protocols to be able to implement them in their field of expertise. Personal and professional attitudes are critical for implementation. In the core of all our efforts should be the patient and his well-being.},

Setting A tertiary academic hospital in the US. Patients 300 medical ICU (MICU) patients. Interventions This MICU-wide project involved a “usual care” baseline stage, followed by a QI stage incorporating multi-faceted sleep-promoting interventions implemented with the aid of daily reminder checklists for ICU staff. Measurements and Main Results Primary ICU outcomes were perceived sleep quality and noise ratings (measured on a 0-100 scale using the valid and reliable Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire [RCSQ]) and delirium/coma-free days. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. Post-ICU measures of cognition and perceived sleep quality were evaluated in an ICU patient subset., During the baseline and sleep QI stages there were 122 and 178 patients, respectively, with {$>$}1 night in the ICU, accounting for 634 and 826 patient-days. Within the groups, 78 (63.9\%) and 83 (46.6\%) patients received mechanical ventilation. Over the 826 patient-day QI period, checklist item completion rates ranged from 86-94\%. In multivariable regression analysis of the QI vs. baseline stages, improvements in overall RCSQ sleep quality ratings did not reach statistical significance, but there were significant improvements in daily noise ratings (mean ± standard deviation: 65.9 ± 26.6 vs. 60.5 ± 26.3, P=0.001), incidence of delirium/coma (odds ratio: 0.46; 95\% confidence interval, 0.23-0.89; P=0.02), and daily delirium/coma-free status (odds ratio: 1.64; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-2.58; P=0.03). Improvements in secondary ICU outcomes and post-ICU outcomes did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions An ICU-wide QI intervention to improve sleep and delirium is feasible and associated with significant improvements in perceived nighttime noise, incidence of delirium/coma, and daily delirium/coma-free status. Improvement in perceived sleep quality did not reach statistical significance.},

  abstract = {In December 2019, COVID-19, a severe respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20\% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies' recommended "supportive care only" avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York. Based on the shared early impressions of "what was working and what wasn't working," the increasing medical journal publications and the rapidly accumulating personal clinical experiences with COVID-19 patients, a treatment protocol was created for the hospitalized patients based on the core therapies of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin and co-interventions (MATH+). This manuscript reviews the scientific and clinical rationale behind MATH+ based on published in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical data in support of each medicine, with a special emphasis of studies supporting their use in the treatment of patients with viral syndromes and COVID-19 specifically. The review concludes with a comparison of published multi-national mortality data with MATH+ center outcomes.},

Further, many publications on COVID-19 have debated the puzzling clinical characteristics of ‘silent hypoxemia’, ‘happy hypoxemics’ and ‘atypical ARDS’, all features consistent with OP. The recent announcement that RECOVERY, a randomised controlled trial comparing dexamethasone to placebo in COVID-19, was terminated early due to excess deaths in the control group further suggests patients present with OP given that corticosteroid therapy is the first-line treatment. Although RECOVERY along with other cohort studies report positive effects with corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, treatment approaches could be made more effective given that secondary OP often requires prolonged duration and/or careful and monitored tapering of corticosteroid dose, with ‘pulse’ doses needed for the well-described fulminant subtype. Increasing recognition of this diagnosis will thus lead to more appropriate and effective treatment strategies in COVID-19, which may lead to a further reduction of need for ventilatory support and improved survival.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with severe malaria or sepsis are at risk of developing life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The objective of this study was to evaluate point-of-care lung ultrasound as a novel tool to determine the prevalence and early signs of ARDS in a resource-limited setting among patients with severe malaria or sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial point-of-care lung ultrasound studies were performed on four consecutive days in a planned sub study of an observational cohort of patients with malaria or sepsis in Bangladesh. We quantified aeration patterns across 12 lung regions. ARDS was defined according to the Kigali Modification of the Berlin Definition. RESULTS: Of 102 patients enrolled, 71 had sepsis and 31 had malaria. Normal lung ultrasound findings were observed in 44 patients on enrolment and associated with 7\% case fatality. ARDS was detected in 10 patients on enrolment and associated with 90\% case fatality. All patients with ARDS had sepsis, 4 had underlying pneumonia. Two patients developing ARDS during hospitalisation already had reduced aeration patterns on enrolment. The SpO2/FiO2 ratio combined with the number of regions with reduced aeration was a strong prognosticator for mortality in patients with sepsis (AUROC 91.5\% (95\% Confidence Interval: 84.6\%-98.4\%)). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of point-of-care lung ultrasound to detect lung abnormalities in patients with malaria or sepsis in a resource-constrained hospital setting. LUS was highly feasible and allowed to accurately identify patients at risk of death in a resource limited setting.},

  abstract = {The possible benefits associated with corticosteroid treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients are not fully known. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO2/FIO2 ratios), and adverse events. Nine studies with 1371 participants were analyzed. The pooled analysis revealed that glucocorticoid use was associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.93; P {$<$} 0.01; I2 = 37], and the statistical power was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Glucocorticoids might also significantly increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (mean deviation 3.66 days, 95\% CI 2.64–4.68; P {$<$} 0.01) and improve oxygenation (standardized mean difference 4.17; 95\% CI 2.32–6.02; P {$<$} 0.01). In addition, glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risks of new infection (RR 0.84; 95\% CI 0.70–1.01; P = 0.07) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95\% CI 0.99–1.23; P = 0.06). The use of glucocorticoids might result in reduced mortality in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.},

The pathogenesis of RLS is not well understood. Despite the efficacy of dopaminergic drugs in the treatment of this disorder, unlike in Parkinson's disease dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra has not been observed in RLS. The etiology of RLS is likely complex, involving multiple neural pathways. RLS-related genes identified in genome-wide association studies can provide insight into the mechanistic basis and pathophysiology of RLS.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Lumbar disc herniation and radiculitis are common elements of low back and lower extremity pain. Among minimally invasive treatments, epidural injections are one of the most commonly performed interventions. However, the literature is mixed about their effectiveness in managing low back and lower extremity pain. In general, individual studies and systematic reviews of epidural steroid injections have been hampered by their study design, baseline differences between treatment groups, inadequate sample sizes, highly controlled settings, lack of validated outcome measures, and the inability to confirm the injectate location because fluoroscopy was not used. STUDY DESIGN A randomized, controlled, double blind, active control trial. SETTING A private, interventional pain management practice, specialty referral center in the United States. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural injections with local anesthetic with or without steroids in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain in patients with disc herniation and radiculitis. METHODS One hundred twenty patients were randomized to two groups: Group I received 10 mL caudal epidural injections of local anesthetic, lidocaine 0.5\%; Group II patients received caudal epidural injections of 0.5\% lidocaine, 9 mL, mixed with 1 mL of steroid. OUTCOME ASSESSMENT: Multiple outcome measures were utilized. The primary outcome measures were Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI). Secondary outcome measures were employment status and opioid intake. Significant pain relief improvement was defined as 50\% or more improvement in NRS and ODI scores. RESULTS In the successful category, 77\% of Group I had significant pain relief of~{$>$}/= 50\% and functional status improvement of {$>$}/=~ 50\% reduction in ODI scores; in Group II it was 76\%, whereas overall it was 60\% and 65\% in Groups I and II. Over the two years, Group I had an average number of procedures of 5.5 ± 2.8; Group II was 5.3 ± 2.4. Even though there was no significant difference in overall relief between the two groups, the average relief for each procedure was superior for steroids. LIMITATIONS Presumed limitations of this evaluation include lack of a placebo group. CONCLUSION Caudal epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids might be an effective therapy for patients with disc herniation or radiculitis. The present evidence illustrates the potential superiority of steroids compared with local anesthetic at two year follow up based on average relief per procedure. TRIAL REGISTRATION NCT0037079.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients receiving an antipsychotic in the ICUs of a large academic medical center from January 1, 2005, to October 31, 2011. Medical record review was conducted to ascertain whether a patient was newly started on antipsychotic therapy and whether therapy was continued post-ICU discharge. RESULTS: A total of 39,248 ICU admissions over the 7-year period were evaluated. Of these, 4468 (11\%) were exposed to antipsychotic therapy, of which 3119 (8\%) were newly initiated. In the newly initiated cohort, 642 (21\%) were continued on therapy on discharge from the hospital. Type of drug (use of quetiapine vs no use of quetiapine: odds ratio, 3.2; 95\% confidence interval, 2.5-4.0; P {$<$} .0001 and use of olanzapine: odds ratio, 2.4, 95\% confidence interval, 2.0-3.1; P ≤ .0001) was a significant risk factor for continuing antipsychotics on discharge despite adjustment for clinical factors.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Increased right ventricle (RV) afterload during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may induce acute cor pulmonale (ACP). OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and prognosis of ACP and build a clinical risk score for the early detection of ACP. METHODS: This was a prospective study in which 752 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS receiving protective ventilation were assessed using transesophageal echocardiography in 11 intensive care units. The study cohort was randomly split in a derivation (n~=~502) and a validation (n~=~250) cohort. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ACP was defined as septal dyskinesia with a dilated RV [end-diastolic RV/left ventricle (LV) area ratio {$>$}0.6 (≥1 for severe dilatation)]. ACP was found in 164 of the 752 patients (prevalence of 22~\%; 95~\% confidence interval 19-25~\%). In the derivation cohort, the ACP risk score included four variables [pneumonia as a cause of ARDS, driving pressure ≥18~cm H2O, arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio {$<$}150~mmHg, and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure ≥48~mmHg]. The ACP risk score had a reasonable discrimination and a good calibration. Hospital mortality did not differ between patients with or without ACP, but it was significantly higher in patients with severe ACP than in the other patients [31/54 (57~\%) vs. 291/698 (42~\%); p~=~0.03]. Independent risk factors for hospital mortality included severe ACP along with male gender, age, SAPS II, shock, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, respiratory rate, and driving pressure, while prone position was protective. CONCLUSIONS: We report a 22~\% prevalence of ACP and a poor outcome of severe ACP. We propose a simple clinical risk score for early identification of ACP that could trigger specific therapeutic strategies to reduce RV afterload.},

The majority of problems that occur during extubation and emergence are of a minor nature, but a small and significant number may result in injury or death. The need for a strategy incorporating extubation is mentioned in several international airway management guidelines, but the subject is not discussed in detail, and the emphasis has been on extubation of the patient with a difficult airway. The Difficult Airway Society has developed guidelines for the safe management of tracheal extubation in adult peri-operative practice. The guidelines discuss the problems arising during extubation and recovery and promote a strategic, stepwise approach to extubation. They emphasise the importance of planning and preparation, and include practical techniques for use in clinical practice and recommendations for post-extubation care.},

Traditional rapid sequence intubation (RSI), the simultaneous administration of an induction agent and muscle relaxant, is more likely to harm patients who do not allow appropriate preparation and preoxygenation, have concerning airway anatomy, or severe hypoxia, acidemia, or hypotension. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, can be used to facilitate two alternatives to RSI to augment airway safety in these scenarios: delayed sequence intubation – the use of ketamine to allow airway preparation and preoxygenation in the agitated patient; and ketamine-only breathing intubation, in which ketamine is used without a paralytic to facilitate ETI as the patient continues to breathe spontaneously. Ketamine may also provide hemodynamic benefits during standard RSI and is a valuable agent for post-intubation analgesia and sedation. When RSI is not an optimal airway management strategy, ketamine’s unique pharmacology can be harnessed to facilitate alternative approaches that may increase patient safety.},

  abstract = {Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a high-risk procedure commonly performed in emergency medicine, critical care, and the prehospital setting. Traditional rapid sequence intubation (RSI), the simultaneous administration of an induction agent and muscle relaxant, is more likely to harm patients who do not allow appropriate preparation and preoxygenation, have concerning airway anatomy, or severe hypoxia, acidemia, or hypotension. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, can be used to facilitate two alternatives to RSI to augment airway safety in these scenarios: delayed sequence intubation – the use of ketamine to allow airway preparation and preoxygenation in the agitated patient; and ketamine-only breathing intubation, in which ketamine is used without a paralytic to facilitate ETI as the patient continues to breathe spontaneously. Ketamine may also provide hemodynamic benefits during standard RSI and is a valuable agent for post-intubation analgesia and sedation. When RSI is not an optimal airway management strategy, ketamine’s unique pharmacology can be harnessed to facilitate alternative approaches that may increase patient safety.},

  abstract = {Background: Insertion of a supraglottic airway and tracheal intubation through it may be indicated in resuscitation scenarios where conventional laryngoscopy fails. Various supraglottic devices have been used as conduits for tracheal intubation, including the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA), the CtrachTM laryngeal mask and the I-gel supraglottic airway. Methods: A prospective study with 25 participants evaluated the success rate of blind intubation (using a gum-elastic bougie, an Aintree intubating catheter (AIC) and designated tracheal tube) and fibrescopeguided tracheal intubation (through the intubating laryngeal mask airway and the I-gel supraglottic airway) on three different airway manikins. Results: Twenty-five anaesthetists performed three intubations with each method on each of three manikins. The success rate of the fibrescope-guided technique was significantly higher than blind attempts (P {$<$} 0.0001) with both devices. For fibreoptic techniques, there was no difference found between the ILMA and I-gel (P {$>$} 0.05). All blind techniques were significantly more successful in the ILMA group compared to the I-gel (P {$<$} 0.0001 for bougie, Aintree catheter and tracheal tube, respectively). Conclusions: The results of this study show that, in manikins, fibreoptic intubation through both ILMA and I-gel is a highly successful technique. Blind intubation through the I-gel showed a low success rate and should not be attempted.},

  abstract = {Background and Aim: Critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation undergo tracheostomy to facilitate weaning. The practice in India may be different from the rest of the world and therefore, in order to understand this, ISCCM conducted a multicentric observational study “DIlatational percutaneous vs Surgical tracheoStomy in intEnsive Care uniT: A practice pattern observational multicenter study (DISSECT Study)”followed by an ISCCM Expert Panel committee meeting to formulate Practice recommendations pertinent to Indian ICUs. Materials and methods: All existing International guidelines on the topic, various randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, systematic reviews, retrospective studies were taken into account to formulate the guidelines. Wherever Indian data was not available, international data was analysed. A modified Grade system was followed for grading the recommendation. Results: After analyzing the entire available data, the recommendations were made by the grading system agreed by the Expert Panel. The recommendations took into account the indications and contraindications of tracheostomy; effect of timing of tracheostomy on incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia, ICU length of stay, ventilator free days \& Mortality; comparison of surgical and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) in terms of incidence of complications and cost to the patient; Comparison of various techniques of PDT; Use of fiberoptic bronchoscope and ultrasound in PDT; experience of the operator and qualification; certain special conditions like coagulopathy and morbid obesity. Conclusion: This document presents the first Indian recommendations on tracheostomy in adult critically ill patients based on the practices of the country. These guidelines are expected to improve the safety and extend the indications of tracheostomy in critically ill patients.},

There are not enough studies that have evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the implementation of these bundles. This study will analyze the implementation process, estimate their effectiveness and safety, and identify barriers, facilitators and attitudes that have influenced the implementation process. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative studies will be eligible for our systematic review with adult patients who have been exposed to the implementation of the ABCDE or ABCDEF bundles compared to the usual care in the ICU. In order to search the implementation interventions of the bundles, we will search electronically: MEDLINE (PubMed); Excerpta Medica Database (Ovid); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCO); The Cochrane Library (Wiley); Web of Science; Virtual Health Library; and OpenGrey. We will not impose any language restrictions or publication status. Outcomes of interest include ICU and hospital length of stay; mechanical ventilation time; incidence and prevalence of delirium or coma; level of agitation and sedation; early mobilization; mortality in ICU and hospital; change in perception, attitude or behavior of the stakeholders; and change in knowledge of health professionals. The team of reviewers will independently screen search results, extract data from eligible studies, and assess risk of bias. Disagreements between the reviewers will be solved through consensus or arbitration by a third-party investigator. To assess the quality and risk of bias in randomized and quasi-randomized trials we will use the domain-based evaluation recommended by The Cochrane Handbook. Studies with other methodological designs will be evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Tools developed by The Joanna Briggs Institute. Other instruments may be used, if necessary. RESULTS: The evidence derived from this study will increase the knowledge of effectiveness and safety of the implementation process of ABCDE and ABCDEF bundles. CONCLUSION: The results could guide patients and healthcare practitioners by helping to facilitate evidence-based shared care decision making. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019121307.},

  abstract = {One approach to manage people with behaviours of concern including agitated or aggressive behaviours in health care settings is through the use of fast-acting medication, called chemical restraint. Such management often needs to be delivered in crisis situations to patients who are at risk of harm to themselves or others. This paper summarizes the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of chemical restraint from 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3788 patients. The RCTs were of moderate to high quality and were conducted in pre-hospital, hospital emergency department, or ward settings. Drugs used in chemical restraint included olanzapine, haloperidol, droperidol, risperidol, flunitrazepam, midazolam, promethazine, ziprasidone, sodium valproate, or lorazepam. There was limited comparability between studies in drug choice, combination, dose, method of administration (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous drip), or timing of repeat administrations. There were 31 outcome measures, which were inconsistently reported. They included subjective measures of behaviours, direct measures of treatment effect (time to calm; time to sleep), indirect measures of agitation (staff or patient injuries, duration of agitative or aggressive episodes, subsequent violent episodes), and adverse events. The most common were time to calm and adverse events. There was little clarity about the superiority of any chemical method of managing behaviours of concern exhibited by patients in Emergency Departments or acute mental health settings. Not only is more targeted research essential, but best practice recommendations for such situations requires integrating expert input into the current evidence base.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented pressure on healthcare system globally. Lack of high-quality evidence on the respiratory management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) has resulted in wide variation in clinical practice. METHODS: Using a Delphi process, an international panel of 39 experts developed clinical practice statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF in areas where evidence is absent or limited. Agreement was defined as achieved when\,{$>$}\,70\% experts voted for a given option on the Likert scale statement or\,{$>$}\,80\% voted for a particular option in multiple-choice questions. Stability was assessed between the two concluding rounds for each statement, using the non-parametric Chi-square (χ2) test (p\,{$<$}\,0·05 was considered as unstable). RESULTS: Agreement was achieved for 27 (73\%) management strategies which were then used to develop expert clinical practice statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS. The Delphi process yielded strong suggestions for use of systemic corticosteroids for critical COVID-19; awake self-proning to improve oxygenation and high flow nasal oxygen to potentially reduce tracheal intubation; non-invasive ventilation for patients with mixed hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure; tracheal intubation for poor mentation, hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia; closed suction systems; lung protective ventilation; prone ventilation (for 16-24~h per day) to improve oxygenation; neuromuscular blocking agents for patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; avoiding delay in extubation for the risk of reintubation; and similar timing of tracheostomy as in non-COVID-19 patients. There was no agreement on positive end expiratory pressure titration or the choice of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements from which 20 expert clinical practice statements were derived on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of endovascular thrombectomy that is performed more than 6 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke is uncertain. Patients with a clinical deficit that is disproportionately severe relative to the infarct volume may benefit from late thrombectomy. METHODS: We enrolled patients with occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery who had last been known to be well 6 to 24 hours earlier and who had a mismatch between the severity of the clinical deficit and the infarct volume, with mismatch criteria defined according to age ({$<$}80 years or ≥80 years). Patients were randomly assigned to thrombectomy plus standard care (the thrombectomy group) or to standard care alone (the control group). The coprimary end points were the mean score for disability on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale (which ranges from 0 [death] to 10 [no symptoms or disability]) and the rate of functional independence (a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the modified Rankin scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) at 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients were enrolled; 107 were assigned to the thrombectomy group and 99 to the control group. At 31 months, enrollment in the trial was stopped because of the results of a prespecified interim analysis. The mean score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 5.5 in the thrombectomy group as compared with 3.4 in the control group (adjusted difference [Bayesian analysis], 2.0 points; 95\% credible interval, 1.1 to 3.0; posterior probability of superiority, {$>$}0.999), and the rate of functional independence at 90 days was 49\% in the thrombectomy group as compared with 13\% in the control group (adjusted difference, 33 percentage points; 95\% credible interval, 24 to 44; posterior probability of superiority, {$>$}0.999). The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the two groups (6\% in the thrombectomy group and 3\% in the control group, P=0.50), nor did 90-day mortality (19\% and 18\%, respectively; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute stroke who had last been known to be well 6 to 24 hours earlier and who had a mismatch between clinical deficit and infarct, outcomes for disability at 90 days were better with thrombectomy plus standard care than with standard care alone.

This analysis of data from the direct reporting of awareness in maternity patients’ (DREAMY) study of accidental awareness during obstetric anaesthesia aimed to describe practice for obstetric general anaesthesia in England and compare with earlier surveys and best-practice recommendations. Consenting patients who received general anaesthesia for obstetric surgery in 72 hospitals from May 2017 to August 2018 were included. Baseline characteristics, airway management, anaesthetic techniques and major complications were collected. Descriptive analysis, binary logistic regression modelling and comparisons with earlier data were conducted. Data were collected from 3117 procedures, including 2554 (81.9\%) caesarean deliveries. Thiopental was the induction drug in 1649 (52.9\%) patients, compared with propofol in 1419 (45.5\%). Suxamethonium was the neuromuscular blocking drug for tracheal intubation in 2631 (86.1\%), compared with rocuronium in 367 (11.8\%). Difficult tracheal intubation was reported in 1 in 19 (95\%CI 1 in 16–22) and failed intubation in 1 in 312 (95\%CI 1 in 169–667). Obese patients were over-represented compared with national baselines and associated with difficult, but not failed intubation. There was more evidence of change in practice for induction drugs (increased use of propofol) than neuromuscular blocking drugs (suxamethonium remains the most popular). There was evidence of improvement in practice, with increased monitoring and reversal of neuromuscular blockade (although this remains suboptimal). Despite a high risk of difficult intubation in this population, videolaryngoscopy was rarely used (1.9\%).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND There has been increased interest in recent years in very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) that, even though they are much discussed and often opposed, have undoubtedly been shown to be effective, at least in the short to medium term, as a tool to tackle obesity, hyperlipidemia and some cardiovascular risk factors. For this reason the ketogenic diet represents an interesting option but unfortunately suffers from a low compliance. The aim of this pilot study is to ascertain the safety and effects of a modified ketogenic diet that utilizes ingredients which are low in carbohydrates but are formulated to simulate its aspect and taste and also contain phytoextracts to add beneficial effects of important vegetable components. METHODS The study group consisted of 106 Rome council employees with a body mass index of ≥ 25, age between 18 and 65 years (19 male and 87 female; mean age 48.49 ± 10.3). We investigated the effects of a modified ketogenic diet based on green vegetables, olive oil, fish and meat plus dishes composed of high quality protein and virtually zero carbohydrate but which mimic their taste, with the addition of some herbal extracts (KEMEPHY ketogenic Mediterranean with phytoextracts). Calories in the diet were unlimited. Measurements were taken before and after 6 weeks of diet. RESULTS There were no significant changes in BUN, ALT, AST, GGT and blood creatinine. We detected a significant (p {$<$} 0.0001) reduction in BMI (31.45 Kg/m2 to 29.01 Kg/m2), body weight (86.15 kg to 79.43 Kg), percentage of fat mass (41.24\% to 34.99\%), waist circumference (106.56 cm to 97.10 cm), total cholesterol (204 mg/dl to 181 mg/dl), LDLc (150 mg/dl to 136 mg/dl), triglycerides (119 mg/dl to 93 mg/dl) and blood glucose (96 mg/dl to 91 mg/dl). There was a significant (p {$<$} 0.0001) increase in HDLc (46 mg/dl to 52 mg/dl). CONCLUSIONS The KEMEPHY diet lead to weight reduction, improvements in cardiovascular risk markers, reduction in waist circumference and showed good compliance.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing use of very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in weight control and management of the metabolic syndrome there is a paucity of research about effects of VLCKD on sport performance. Ketogenic diets may be useful in sports that include weight class divisions and the aim of our study was to investigate the influence of VLCKD on explosive strength performance. METHODS: 8 athletes, elite artistic gymnasts (age 20.9 +/- 5.5 yrs) were recruited. We analyzed body composition and various performance aspects (hanging straight leg raise, ground push up, parallel bar dips, pull up, squat jump, countermovement jump, 30 sec continuous jumps) before and after 30 days of a modified ketogenic diet. The diet was based on green vegetables, olive oil, fish and meat plus dishes composed of high quality protein and virtually zero carbohydrates, but which mimicked their taste, with the addition of some herbal extracts. During the VLCKD the athletes performed the normal training program. After three months the same protocol, tests were performed before and after 30 days of the athletes' usual diet (a typically western diet, WD). A one-way Anova for repeated measurements was used. RESULTS: No significant differences were detected between VLCKD and WD in all strength tests. Significant differences were found in body weight and body composition: after VLCKD there was a decrease in body weight (from 69.6 +/- 7.3 Kg to 68.0 +/- 7.5 Kg) and fat mass (from 5.3 +/- 1.3 Kg to 3.4 +/- 0.8 Kg p {$<$} 0.001) with a non-significant increase in muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns of coaches and doctors about the possible detrimental effects of low carbohydrate diets on athletic performance and the well known importance of carbohydrates there are no data about VLCKD and strength performance. The undeniable and sudden effect of VLCKD on fat loss may be useful for those athletes who compete in sports based on weight class. We have demonstrated that using VLCKD for a relatively short time period (i.e. 30 days) can decrease body weight and body fat without negative effects on strength performance in high level athletes.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Although several international guidelines recommend early over late intubation of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this issue is still controversial. We aimed to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation. “Early” was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while “late” as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission. All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147). Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included. There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4\% versus 39.1\%; RR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.99–1.15, p\,=\,0.08). This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD −\,0.58 days, 95\% CI −\,3.06 to 1.89 days, p\,=\,0.65). In a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of early/late intubation, intubation without versus with a prior trial of high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was still not associated with a statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality (1128 deaths; 48.9\% versus 42.5\%; RR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.99–1.25, p\,=\,0.08). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The synthesized evidence suggests that timing of intubation may have no effect on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19. These results might justify a wait-and-see approach, which may lead to fewer intubations. Relevant guidelines may therefore need to be updated.},

  abstract = {Emergency and difficult tracheal intubations are hazardous undertakings where successive laryngoscopy-hypoxaemia-re-oxygenation cycles can escalate to airway loss and the 'can't intubate, can't ventilate' scenario. Between 2013 and 2014, we extended the apnoea times of 25 patients with difficult airways who were undergoing general anaesthesia for hypopharyngeal or laryngotracheal surgery. This was achieved through continuous delivery of transnasal high-flow humidified oxygen, initially to provide pre-oxygenation, and continuing as post-oxygenation during intravenous induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular blockade until a definitive airway was secured. Apnoea time commenced at administration of neuromuscular blockade and ended with commencement of jet ventilation, positive-pressure ventilation or recommencement of spontaneous ventilation. During this time, upper airway patency was maintained with jaw-thrust. Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) was used in 15 males and 10 females. Mean (SD [range]) age at treatment was 49 (15 [25-81])~years. The median (IQR [range]) Mallampati grade was 3 (2-3 [2-4]) and direct laryngoscopy grade was 3 (3-3 [2-4]). There were 12 obese patients and nine patients were stridulous. The median (IQR [range]) apnoea time was 14 (9-19 [5-65]) min. No patient experienced arterial desaturation {$<~$}90\%. Mean (SD [range]) post-apnoea end-tidal (and in four patients, arterial) carbon dioxide level was 7.8 (2.4 [4.9-15.3])~kPa. The rate of increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide was 0.15~kPa.min(-1) . We conclude that THRIVE combines the benefits of 'classical' apnoeic oxygenation with continuous positive airway pressure and gaseous exchange through flow-dependent deadspace flushing. It has the potential to transform the practice of anaesthesia by changing the nature of securing a definitive airway in emergency and difficult intubations from a pressured stop-start process to a smooth and unhurried undertaking.},

In this paper, we review the literature to find trends in CDSSs that were developed over the last few decades and give some indication of future directions in developing successful, usable clinical decision-support systems. METHODS: We searched PubMed for papers that were published during the past five years with the words Decision Support Systems appearing in the title and used our own knowledge of the field for earlier work. RESULTS: The goals of developers of modern CDSSs are to develop systems that deliver needed information and could be integrated with the healthcare's organizational dynamics. Such CDSSs form part of knowledge-management activities that healthcare organizations employ in order to excel. During the past few decades, we have witnessed a gradual maturation of knowledge representation formalisms and the needed infrastructure for developing integrated CDSSs, including electronic health record systems (EHR), standard terminologies, and messaging standards for exchange of clinical data. The demand for CDSSs that are effective and that will evolve as circumstances change gave rise to methodologies that guide developers on the construction and evaluation of CDSSs. CONCLUSION: Although there exist many approaches for representing, managing and delivering clinical knowledge, the design and implementation of good and useful systems that will last and evolve are still active areas of research. The gradual maturation of EHR and infrastructure standards should make it possible for CDSSs implementers to make major contributions to the delivery of healthcare.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Semi-quantification of lung aeration by ultrasound helps to assess presence and extent of pulmonary pathologies, including the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is uncertain which lung regions add most to the diagnostic accuracy for ARDS of the frequently used global lung ultrasound (LUS) score. We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the global versus those of regional LUS scores in invasively ventilated intensive care unit patients. METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of a single-center observational study in the mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated hospital in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients, aged ≥\,18~years, and are expected to receive invasive ventilation for {$>$}\,24~h underwent a LUS examination within the first 2~days of ventilation. The Berlin Definition was used to diagnose ARDS, and to classify ARDS severity. From the 12-region LUS examinations, the global score (minimum 0 to maximum 36) and 3 regional scores (the 'anterior,' 'lateral,' and 'posterior' score, minimum 0 to maximum 12) were computed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated and the best cutoff for ARDS discrimination was determined for all scores. RESULTS: The study enrolled 152 patients; 35 patients had ARDS. The global score was higher in patients with ARDS compared to patients without ARDS (median 19 [15-23] vs. 5 [3-9]; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The posterior score was the main contributor to the global score, and was the only score that increased significantly with ARDS severity. However, the posterior score performed worse than the global score in diagnosing ARDS, and it had a positive predictive value of only 50 (41-59)\% when using the optimal cutoff. The combined anterolateral score performed as good as the global score (AUROC of 0.91 [0.85-0.97] vs. 0.91 [0.86-0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: While the posterior score increases with ARDS severity, its diagnostic accuracy for ARDS is hampered due to an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio. An 8-region 'anterolateral' score performs as well as the global score and may prove useful to exclude ARDS in invasively ventilated ICU patients.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose- The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with {$>$}100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines.Methods—Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council’s Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with {$>$}100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers’ comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format.Results—These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks.

  abstract = {BackgroundA categorical CT assessment scheme for suspicion of pulmonary involvement                             of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 provides a basis for gathering                             scientific evidence and improved communication with referring                             physicians.PurposeTo introduce the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) for use in                             the standardized assessment of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on                             unenhanced chest CT images and to report its initial interobserver                             agreement and performance.Materials and MethodsThe Dutch Radiological Society developed CO-RADS based on other efforts                             for standardization, such as the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System                             or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. CO-RADS assesses the                             suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very                             low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients with                             moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated by                             using 105 chest CT scans of patients admitted to the hospital with                             clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and in whom reverse                             transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed (mean, 62                             years ± 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR                             results). Eight observers used CO-RADS to assess the scans. Fleiss                             κ value was calculated, and scores of individual observers were                             compared with the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting                             area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was                             compared with results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of                             COVID-19.ResultsThere was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2\%) of 840                             observations. Fleiss κ value was 0.47 (95\% confidence interval                             [CI]: 0.45, 0.47), with the highest κ value for CO-RADS categories                             1 (0.58, 95\% CI: 0.54, 0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.72). The                             average AUC was 0.91 (95\% CI: 0.85, 0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome                             and 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.91, 0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false-negative                             rate for CO-RADS 1 was nine of 161 cases (5.6\%; 95\% CI: 1.0\%, 10\%), and                             the false-positive rate for CO-RADS category 5 was one of 286 (0.3\%; 95\%                             CI: 0\%, 1.0\%).ConclusionThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System                             (CO-RADS) is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement                             of COVID-19 at unenhanced chest CT that performs very well in predicting                             COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has                             substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and                             5.©\,RSNA, 2020Online supplemental material is available for this                                     article.},

  abstract = {Since the beginning of March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more than 13,000 deaths in Europe, almost 54\% of which has occurred in Italy. The Italian healthcare system is experiencing a stressful burden, especially in terms of intensive care assistance. In fact, the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, that in many cases, results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support. A precocious respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen should be avoided to limit the droplets’ air-dispersion and the healthcare workers’ contamination. The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by means of a helmet can represent an effective alternative to recruit diseased alveolar units and improve hypoxemia. It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability. However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls. It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation. Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.},

Recently, its use has increased for a variety of clinical indications. To guide clinical practice, we developed evidence-based recommendations regarding use of HFNC in various clinical settings. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We formed a guideline panel composed of clinicians, methodologists and experts in respiratory medicine. Using GRADE, the panel developed recommendations for four actionable questions. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The guideline panel made a strong recommendation for HFNC in hypoxemic respiratory failure compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) (moderate certainty), a conditional recommendation for HFNC following extuba‑tion (moderate certainty), no recommendation regarding HFNC in the peri-intubation period (moderate certainty), and a conditional recommendation for postoperative HFNC in high risk and/or obese patients following cardiac or thoracic surgery (moderate certainty). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} This clinical practice guideline synthesizes current best-evidence into four recommendations for HFNC use in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, following extubation, in the peri-intubation period, and postopera‑tively for bedside clinicians.},

  abstract = {Caesarean section is associated with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain, which can influence postoperative recovery and patient satisfaction as well as breastfeeding success and mother-child bonding. The aim of this systematic review was to update the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after elective caesarean section under neuraxial anaesthesia. A systematic review utilising procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language between 1 May 2014 and 22 October 2020 evaluating the effects of analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions were retrieved from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases. Studies evaluating pain management for emergency or unplanned operative deliveries or caesarean section performed under general anaesthesia were excluded. A total of 145 studies met the inclusion criteria. For patients undergoing elective caesarean section performed under neuraxial anaesthesia, recommendations include intrathecal morphine 50–100 µg or diamorphine 300 µg administered pre-operatively; paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone administered after delivery. If intrathecal opioid was not administered, single-injection local anaesthetic wound infiltration; continuous wound local anaesthetic infusion; and/or fascial plane blocks such as transversus abdominis plane or quadratus lumborum blocks are recommended. The postoperative regimen should include regular paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with opioids used for rescue. The surgical technique should include a Joel-Cohen incision; non-closure of the peritoneum; and abdominal binders. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation could be used as analgesic adjunct. Some of the interventions, although effective, carry risks, and consequentially were omitted from the recommendations. Some interventions were not recommended due to insufficient, inconsistent or lack of evidence. Of note, these recommendations may not be applicable to unplanned deliveries or caesarean section performed under general anaesthesia.},

  abstract = {In the author's clinical experience, concurrent treatment with DL-phenylalanine (DLPA) often appears to potentiate pain relief and also ease depression in patients receiving opiates for chronic non-malignant pain. An analysis of this phenomenon suggests that it may be mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of the 'endogenous analgesia system' (EAS), a neural pathway that projects caudally from medullary nuclei to the dorsal horn of the spinal column; when stimulated by chronic pain or therapeutic measures such as opiates or acupuncture, the EAS suppresses activation of second-order pain-receptive neurons in the dorsal horn, and thereby alleviates pain. Since serotonin and enkephalins are key neurotransmitters in the EAS, it is reasonable to predict that measures which promote serotonin activity (such as 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin-reuptake inhibitors) as well as enkephalin activity (such as D-phenylalanine, an enkephalinase inhibitor) should potentiate EAS-mediated analgesia - a view consistent with much previous medical research. Comprehensive support of the EAS with well-tolerated nutrients and pharmaceuticals may amplify the analgesic efficacy of chronic opiate therapy, while enabling dosage reductions that minimize opiate side-effects. Analogously, this approach may complement the efficacy of acupuncture and other analgesic measures that activate the EAS.},

Limited information is available on adverse peri-intubation events. Objective: To evaluate the incidence and nature of adverse peri-intubation events and to assess current practice of intubation in critically ill patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: The International Observational Study to Understand the Impact and Best Practices of Airway Management in Critically Ill Patients (INTUBE) study was an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study involving consecutive critically ill patients undergoing tracheal intubation in the intensive care units (ICUs), emergency departments, and wards, from October 1, 2018, to July 31, 2019 (August 28, 2019, was the final follow-up) in a convenience sample of 197 sites from 29 countries across 5 continents. Exposures: Tracheal intubation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse peri-intubation events defined as at least 1 of the following events occurring within 30 minutes from the start of the intubation procedure: cardiovascular instability (either: systolic pressure {$<$}65 mm Hg at least once, {$<$}90 mm Hg for {$>$}30 minutes, new or increase need of vasopressors or fluid bolus {$>$}15 mL/kg), severe hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation {$<$}80\%) or cardiac arrest. The secondary outcomes included intensive care unit mortality. Results: Of 3659 patients screened, 2964 (median age, 63 years; interquartile range [IQR], 49-74 years; 62.6\% men) from 197 sites across 5 continents were included. The main reason for intubation was respiratory failure in 52.3\% of patients, followed by neurological impairment in 30.5\%, and cardiovascular instability in 9.4\%. Primary outcome data were available for all patients. Among the study patients, 45.2\% experienced at least 1 major adverse peri-intubation event. The predominant event was cardiovascular instability, observed in 42.6\% of all patients undergoing emergency intubation, followed by severe hypoxemia (9.3\%) and cardiac arrest (3.1\%). Overall ICU mortality was 32.8\%.

  abstract = {Hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) is the main cause of death in patients who are comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A poor neurological outcome—defined as death from neurological cause, persistent vegetative state, or severe neurological disability—can be predicted in these patients by assessing the severity of HIBI. The most commonly used indicators of severe HIBI include bilateral absence of corneal and pupillary reflexes, bilateral absence of N2O waves of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials, high blood concentrations of neuron specific enolase, unfavourable patterns on electroencephalogram, and signs of diffuse HIBI on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Current guidelines recommend performing prognostication no earlier than 72~h after return of spontaneous circulation in all comatose patients with an absent or extensor motor response to pain, after having excluded confounders such as residual sedation that may interfere with clinical examination. A multimodal approach combining multiple prognostication tests is recommended so that the risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction is minimised.},

The clinical reference method for BP monitoring in high-risk surgical patients and critically ill patients is continuous invasive BP measurement using an arterial catheter. A key prerequisite for correct invasive BP monitoring using an arterial catheter is an in-depth understanding of the measurement principle, of BP waveform quality criteria, and of common pitfalls that can falsify BP readings. Here, we describe how to place an arterial catheter, correctly measure BP, and identify and solve common pitfalls. We focus on 5 important steps, namely (1) how to choose the catheter insertion site, (2) how to choose the type of arterial catheter, (3) how to place the arterial catheter, (4) how to level and zero the transducer, and (5) how to check the quality of the BP waveform.},

Materials and Methods Narrative review of existing literature published in indexed medical and health informatics journals and of gray literature available on the Internet and personal communication with authors and researchers engaged in SNOMED-CT projects related to critical care are conducted. Results Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms is a system of comprehensive health and clinical terminology that covers most of the needs of health care documentation. It will potentially become the terminology of clinical enterprise and administrative information systems. Despite a ground swell of international support from health information management experts, the terminology remains unknown to most clinicians. We discuss the reasons why clinical familiarity with SNOMED-CT is an important prerequisite to proceeding with local or national electronic health records or clinical information systems. Conclusions We propose that SNOMED-CT is suitable for use in critical care; however, work is urgently required to validate the completeness of terminology and to determine clinicians' perceptions on the utility of such a standardized terminology for use in critical care clinical information systems.},

The authors propose, based on these experiences, that the cause of a number of unexpected difficulties in human-computer interaction lies in users' unwillingness or inability to make structure, content, or procedures explicit. Besides recounting experiences with system use, this paper discusses why users reject or circumvent formalisms which require such explicit expression, and suggests how system designers can anticipate and compensate for problems users have in making implicit aspects of their tasks explicit. The authors propose computational approaches that address this problem, including incremental and system-assisted formalization mechanisms and methods for recognizing and using undeclared structure; they also propose non-computational solutions that involve designers and users reaching a shared understanding of the task situation and the methods that motivate the formalisms. This paper poses that, while it is impossible to remove all formalisms from computing systems, system designers need to match the level of formal expression entailed with the goals and situation of the users -- a design criteria not commonly mentioned in current interface design.},

  abstract = {Observational studies often seek to estimate the causal relevance of an exposure to an outcome of interest. However, many possible biases can arise when estimating such relationships, in particular bias because of confounding. To control for confounding properly, careful consideration of the nature of the assumed relationships between the exposure, the outcome, and other characteristics is required. Causal diagrams provide a simple graphic means of displaying such relationships, describing the assumptions made, and allowing for the identification of a set of characteristics that should be taken into account (i.e., adjusted for) in any analysis. Furthermore, causal diagrams can be used to identify other possible sources of bias (such as selection bias), which if understood from the outset, can inform the planning of appropriate analyses. In this article, we review the basic theory of causal diagrams and describe some of the methods available to identify which characteristics need to be taken into account when estimating the total effect of an exposure on an outcome. In doing so, we review the concept of collider bias and show how it is inappropriate to adjust for characteristics that may be influenced, directly or indirectly, by both the exposure and the outcome of interest. A motivating example is taken from the Study of Heart and Renal Protection, in which the relevance of smoking to progression to ESRD is considered.},

  abstract = {Purpose To determine the feasibility of conducting a multicenter ICU RCT of AFS compared to either protocol-directed sedation (PDS) or both PDS and daily sedation interruption (DSI) in North America. Materials and methods This single-center RCT compared AFS [fentanyl (bolus ± infusions) to reach CPOT ≤2; if RASS ≥1, CPOT ≤2 and additional fentanyl failed to reach RASS goal (−2 to 0), low-dose propofol (up to 6 h) was given] with either PDS or both PDS and DSI daily in adults mechanically ventilated (MV) ≥48 h. Relevant feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes were defined and evaluated. Results 90 of 160 eligible patients were enrolled [AFS = 27; PDS = 28; PDS + DSI = 31]; rate = 3/month. Time from intubation to randomization was 17.5 ± 11.6 h. Study days fully adherent to the study intervention [AFS = 95\%; PDS = 99\%; PDS + DSI = 96\%] and time spent in the first 48 h after randomization without pain (CPOT ≤2)[AFS = 82\%; PDS = 78\%; PDS + DSI = 77\%] and at goal RASS[AFS = 88\%; PDS = 83\%; PDS + DSI = 95\%] were high and similar. Nurse-perceived [median (IQR)] study workload (10-point VAS) was higher with AFS [4(2–6)] than PDS [1(1–3)] or PDS + DSI [2(1–5)]; p = .002). Unplanned extubation was rare (AFS = 1; PDS = 0; PDS + DSI = 1). Days [median (IQR)] free of MV in the 28d after intubation [AFS 24(23,26); PDS 24(20,26); PDS + DSI 24(21,26)] was not different (p = .62). Conclusion A multicenter RCT evaluating AFS is feasible to conduct in North America.},

  abstract = {We propose that humans spontaneously organize environments into clusters of states that support hierarchical planning, enabling them to tackle challenging problems by breaking them down into sub-problems at various levels of abstraction. People constantly rely on such hierarchical presentations to accomplish tasks big and small-from planning one's day, to organizing a wedding, to getting a PhD-often succeeding on the very first attempt. We formalize a Bayesian model of hierarchy discovery that explains how humans discover such useful abstractions. Building on principles developed in structure learning and robotics, the model predicts that hierarchy discovery should be sensitive to the topological structure, reward distribution, and distribution of tasks in the environment. In five simulations, we show that the model accounts for previously reported effects of environment structure on planning behavior, such as detection of bottleneck states and transitions. We then test the novel predictions of the model in eight behavioral experiments, demonstrating how the distribution of tasks and rewards can influence planning behavior via the discovered hierarchy, sometimes facilitating and sometimes hindering performance. We find evidence that the hierarchy discovery process unfolds incrementally across trials. Finally, we propose how hierarchy discovery and hierarchical planning might be implemented in the brain. Together, these findings present an important advance in our understanding of how the brain might use Bayesian inference to discover and exploit the hidden hierarchical structure of the environment.},

  abstract = {Achieving successful treatment of postoperative pain remains a challenge. Recently, a sufentanil sublingual tablet system has been developed for treatment of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. The phenylpiperidine sufentanil is a potent analgesic that rapidly crosses the blood–brain barrier and selectively activates central μ-opioid receptors. The system makes use of a hand-held dispenser system, which contains forty 15-μg sufentanil sublingual micro-tablets. The patient can release one tablet at 20-min intervals using a unique radiofrequency adhesive tag, which is wrapped around the patient's thumb. In this review, the authors discuss the pharmacology of sublingual sufentanil with reference to its suitability in the treatment of postoperative pain, the current evidence for the sublingual sufentanil system in postoperative pain treatment, and advantages and limitations of the sublingual system. We conclude that sufentanil is suited for the transmucosal route due to its pharmacokinetic profile, including rapid onset, absence of active metabolites and low tissue accumulation. The efficacy and safety of the sufentanil sublingual tablet system has been shown in over 600 patients in a limited set of studies; further independent studies are required to determine the position of the system among other forms of postoperative pain treatment. We conclude that the sublingual sufentanil tablet system allows effective pain relief, and allows patients to control their own pain relief and early postoperative mobility.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether tocilizumab improves clinical outcomes for patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Design Randomised, open label trial. Setting Nine hospitals in Brazil, 8 May to 17 July 2020. Participants Adults with confirmed covid-19 who were receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and had abnormal levels of at least two serum biomarkers (C reactive protein, D dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, or ferritin). The data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial early, after 129 patients had been enrolled, because of an increased number of deaths at 15 days in the tocilizumab group. Interventions Tocilizumab (single intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg) plus standard care (n=65) versus standard care alone (n=64). Main outcome measure The primary outcome, clinical status measured at 15 days using a seven level ordinal scale, was analysed as a composite of death or mechanical ventilation because the assumption of odds proportionality was not met. Results A total of 129 patients were enrolled (mean age 57 (SD 14) years; 68\% men) and all completed follow-up. All patients in the tocilizumab group and two in the standard care group received tocilizumab. 18 of 65 (28\%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 13 of 64 (20\%) in the standard care group were receiving mechanical ventilation or died at day 15 (odds ratio 1.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.66 to 3.66; P=0.32). Death at 15 days occurred in 11 (17\%) patients in the tocilizumab group compared with 2 (3\%) in the standard care group (odds ratio 6.42, 95\% confidence interval 1.59 to 43.2). Adverse events were reported in 29 of 67 (43\%) patients who received tocilizumab and 21 of 62 (34\%) who did not receive tocilizumab. Conclusions In patients with severe or critical covid-19, tocilizumab plus standard care was not superior to standard care alone in improving clinical outcomes at 15 days, and it might increase mortality.

  abstract = {The importance of incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in clinical informatics research has been increasingly recognized over the past years, and has led to transformative advances. Typically, clinical NLP systems are developed and evaluated on word, sentence, or document level annotations that model specific attributes and features, such as document content (e.g., patient status, or report type), document section types (e.g., current medications, past medical history, or discharge summary), named entities and concepts (e.g., diagnoses, symptoms, or treatments) or semantic attributes (e.g., negation, severity, or temporality). From a clinical perspective, on the other hand, research studies are typically modelled and evaluated on a patient- or population-level, such as predicting how a patient group might respond to specific treatments or patient monitoring over time. While some NLP tasks consider predictions at the individual or group user level, these tasks still constitute a minority. Owing to the discrepancy between scientific objectives of each field, and because of differences in methodological evaluation priorities, there is no clear alignment between these evaluation approaches. Here we provide a broad summary and outline of the challenging issues involved in defining appropriate intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods for NLP research that is to be used for clinical outcomes research, and vice versa. A particular focus is placed on mental health research, an area still relatively understudied by the clinical NLP research community, but where NLP methods are of notable relevance. Recent advances in clinical NLP method development have been significant, but we propose more emphasis needs to be placed on rigorous evaluation for the field to advance further. To enable this, we provide actionable suggestions, including a minimal protocol that could be used when reporting clinical NLP method development and its evaluation.},

Classification of patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) using the cur‑rent definitions for invasive fungal diseases has proven difficult, and our aim was to develop case definitions for IAPA that can facilitate clinical studies. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A group of 29 international experts reviewed current insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and man‑agement of IAPA and proposed a case definition of IAPA through a process of informal consensus. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Since IAPA may develop in a wide range of hosts, an entry criterion was proposed and not host factors. The entry criterion was defined as a patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress with a positive influenza test temporally related to ICU admission. In addition, proven IAPA required histological evidence of invasive septate hyphae and mycological evidence for Aspergillus. Probable IAPA required the detection of galactomannan or positive Aspergillus culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum with pulmonary infiltrates or a positive culture in upper respiratory samples with bronchoscopic evidence for tracheobronchitis or cavitating pulmonary infiltrates of recent onset. The IAPA case definitions may be useful to classify patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), while awaiting further studies that provide more insight into the interaction between Aspergillus and the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung.},

DESIGN: Prospective open clinical study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Seventy-five consecutive ARDS patients given respiratory support with airway pressure limitation (plateau pressure {$<$} or =30 cm H2O). INTERVENTIONS: ACP was defined as a ratio of right ventricular end-diastolic area to left ventricular end-diastolic area in the long axis {$>$}0.6 associated with septal dyskinesia in the short axis during TEE examination. RESULTS: Normal right ventricular function was present in 56 patients, whereas right ventricular dysfunction was observed in 19 patients after 2 days of respiratory support. ACP was associated with pulmonary artery hypertension, increased heart rate, and decreased stroke index. Significant impairment of left ventricular diastolic function was also seen. All echo-Doppler abnormalities were reversible in patients who recovered, and the mortality rate was the same in both groups (32\%). However, ACP patients who recovered required a longer period of respiratory support. A multivariate analysis individualized Paco2 level as the sole factor independently associated with ACP, suggesting that ACP development in ARDS is influenced by the severity of lung damage and/or the respiratory strategy. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of right ventricular function by TEE in a group of 75 ARDS patients submitted to protective ventilation revealed the persistence of a 25\% incidence of ACP, resulting in detrimental hemodynamic consequences associated with tachycardia. However, ACP was reversible in patients who recovered and did not increase mortality.},

Opioids are the mainstay of pain management in the ICU but are limited by their adverse effects, risk of addiction and abuse, and recent drug shortages of injectable formulations. A multimodal analgesia approach, utilizing nonopioid analgesics as adjuncts to opioid therapy, is recommended since they may modulate the pain response and reduce opioid requirements by acting on multiple pain mediators. Nonopioid analgesics discussed in detail in this article are acetaminophen, α-2 receptor agonists, gabapentinoids, ketamine, lidocaine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This literature review describes the clinical pharmacology, supportive ICU and relevant non-ICU data, and practical considerations associated with the administration of nonopioid analgesics in critically ill adult patients.},

  abstract = {Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection that is independently associated with mortality. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment have been shown to improve the prognosis of VAP. Chest X-ray or computed tomography imaging are used for conventional assessment of VAP, but these methods are impractical for real-time measurement in critical patients. Therefore, lung ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used for the assessment of VAP in the ICU. Traditionally, LUS has seemed unsuitable for the detection of lung parenchyma owing to the high acoustic impedance of air; however, the fact that the reflection and reverberation in the detection region of the ultrasound reflect the underlying pathology of lung diseases has led to the increased use of ultrasound imaging as a standard of care supported by evidence-based and expert consensus in the ICU. Considering that any type of pneumonia causes air volume changes in the lungs, accumulating evidence has shown that LUS effectively measures the presence of VAP as well as dynamic changes in VAP. This review offers evidence for ultrasound as a noninvasive, easily repeatable, and bedside means to assess VAP; in addition, it establishes a protocol for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of VAP.},

  abstract = {The UK influenza pandemic plan predicts up to 750 000 additional deaths with hospitals prioritising patients against inadequate resources. We investigated three prototype low-cost, gas-efficient, pneumatic ventilators in a test lung model at different compliance and rate settings. Mean (SD) oxygen consumption was 0.913 (0.198) and 1.119 (0.267) l.min)1 at tidal volumes of 500 ml and 700 ml respectively. Values of FIO2 increased marginally as lung compliance reduced, reflecting the increased ventilator workload and consequent increased enrichment of breathing gas by waste oxygen from the pneumatic mechanism. We also demonstrated that a stable nitric oxide concentration could be delivered by this design following volumetric principles. It is possible to make a gas-efficient ventilator costing less than £200 from industrial components for use where oxygen is available at 2-4 bar, with no pressurised air or electrical requirements. Such a device could be mass-produced for crises characterised by an overwhelming demand for mechanical ventilation and a limited oxygen supply.},

  abstract = {PubMed is an essential resource for the medical domain, but useful concepts are either difficult to extract or are ambiguated, which has significantly hindered knowledge discovery. To address this issue, we constructed a PubMed knowledge graph (PKG) by extracting bio-entities from 29 million PubMed abstracts, disambiguating author names, integrating funding data through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ExPORTER, collecting affiliation history and educational background of authors from ORCID, and identifying fine-grained affiliation data from MapAffil. Through the integration of the credible multi-source data, we could create connections among the bio-entities, authors, articles, affiliations, and funding. Data validation revealed that the BioBERT deep learning method of bio-entity extraction significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art models based on the F1 score (by 0.51\%), with the author name disambiguation (AND) achieving a F1 score of 98.09\%. PKG can trigger broader innovations, not only enabling us to measure scholarly impact, knowledge usage, and knowledge transfer, but also assisting us in profiling authors and organizations based on their connections with bio-entities. The PKG is freely available on Figshare (https://figshare.com/s/6327a55355fc2c99f3a2, simplified version that exclude PubMed raw data) and TACC website (http://er.tacc.utexas.edu/datasets/ped, full version).},
